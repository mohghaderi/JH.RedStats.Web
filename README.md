# Getting Started

The configuration is hard coded in `JH.RedStats.Interfaces/RedditConnectionSettings.cs`

Run project `JH.RedStats.Web` and wait for the UI to load.

# Disclaimer

There are many things that can be improved in this project that I avoided due to the time contraint. Please consider this fact while reviewing the code.
